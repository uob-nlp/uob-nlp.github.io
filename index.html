							<p>We are a group of researchers within the the <strong>AI Lab</strong>, part of the Bristol's <strong><a href=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/intelligent-systems/>Intelligent Systems Lab</a></strong>, who conduct research into  <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP). </strong> Our members belong to two schools, <strong><a href=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/>Engineering Mathematics and Technology</a></strong> and <strong><a href=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/computer-science/>Computer Science</a>.</strong> </p>
							
							<p>NLP is a sub-field of <strong>artifical intelligence (AI)</strong> that studies how computers can interpret and produce human language, in the form of <strong>text or speech</strong>. The methods we develop aim to extract insights from vast quantities of text, allowing us to tap into the wealth of knowledge in written documents, and help us to communicate better with one another, as well as with machines. </p>

							<p>We carry out <strong>foundational research</strong> on diverse topics within NLP, including modelling concepts and meaning, information extraction, summarisation, human-in-the-loop NLP, and interactive learning from natural language instructions. Our work is <strong>interdisciplinary,</strong> addressing <strong>applications</strong> such as medical research, healthcare, and education, and drawing on linguistics, deep learning, Bayesian statistics, quantum theory, cognitive science and knowledge graphs.  </p>

							<p> 
							The <a href=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/intelligent-systems/>intelligent systems lab</a> is a federated research group that connects researchers across different fields of AI, data science, neuroscience, financial technology, and collective dynamics. Being part of this broader grouping helps our members draw insights from other branches of AI and collaborate on a wide range of application areas.
