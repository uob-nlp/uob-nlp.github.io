                <h2>Open project: Instruction Following for Resource Efficient AI Models</h2>
                <p>
                  Large language models (LLMs) are known for their ability to follow instructions and learn from examples provided inside a prompt. This provides an extremely powerful interface for people to interact with machines and ask them to perform tasks, such as to collate and summarise information in a particular format. However, LLMs demand a huge amount of resources in terms of computing power, memory and energy, and can be outperformed by smaller, specialised models for tasks like text classification in a specific domain [1]. This project explores how to develop instruction following capabilities for smaller neural network models, aiming to create efficient models that can be adapted to specialised tasks by end users through prompts. The project will investigate approaches such as distillation from LLMs to small models [2] to combine multiple user instructions, and the potential to learn from explanations [3] provided by a human-in-the-loop to correct a model’s errors. The supervisor has several ongoing industry and academic partnerships, which will allow the PhD student to target their research towards a real-world information processing application in healthcare, medical research, finance, or intelligence analysis.
