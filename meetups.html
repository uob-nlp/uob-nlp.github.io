                            <h2>Tuesdays 1:00pm~2:00pm, every two weeks @ Clifton Campus</h2>
                            <p><strong>
                            This is an informal gathering for researchers and students interested in NLP. The meetings rotate between reading groups, talks, and workshops.
                            </strong> We aim to share ideas, give each other feedback, and keep up with exciting develops in NLP. Most of our members are PhD students, but we also have many academics and postdocs attending, as well as undergrads and MSc students with an interest in NLP. All are welcome! 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            This is a small and friendly group, so please get in touch with Edwin (e d w i n . s i m p s o n @ b r i s t o l . a c . u k) if you would like to join us. Information for members is available on <a href=https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-NLP-Meetups/SitePages/NLP-Meetups.aspx>our Sharepoint site</a> (please ask to be added).

                            <h2>Reading Groups</h2>
						    <p>How it works: each session, we choose one interesting paper to read and discuss together in the group. Please add your suggestions to the <a href=https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/grp-NLP-Meetups/EdICMumhY1FGshXRyPuORUEBBUfUNAOiqJjag2cJv-6HIw>"reading group suggestions" sheet</a>. Why: This gives you a chance to hear different views on a paper, share connections to other related work aim, and explore topics beyond your current research project.</p>
						    <hr class="major" />

                            <h2>Talks</h2>
						    <p>How it works: each session, a different group member or guest will present a research topic. This could be a practice presentation for a conference, a topic you have been learning about recently, or a brand new idea that you'd like some feedback on. 
						    Why: A chance to get feedback and practice giving presentations; or get others involved in your work, and maybe solve some difficult challenges together. It's also a great way to find out what other people are working on and who is an expert in what!
						    </p>

                            <h2>Workshops</h2>
                            <p>How it works: 
                            each session has a different theme, e.g., "paper drafts in progress" or "software development tools". This is a chance to get feedback on your work-in-progress without giving a presentation, or to share knowledge about research tools and skills, covering aspects of the NLP research process from data gathering to software development to paper writing...
                            Why: A chance to fill in gaps in your skillset, and get feedback on our work. Please also propose ideas for workshop topics that would be useful for you!   
                            </p>
